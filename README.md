# Coursera-Roster-Database-in-Python-SQL
This is a program that was written and used in a Python certification course that I did on coursera.
This code examines a JSON file and creates a databse (I used DB Browser for SQLITE).
It sorts the database into three criteria: User, Course ID, and Role(teacher or student)
Thanks!
